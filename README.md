Hello, I am @Lijo Lawrance. A developer who is interested in doing lots of coding. A Data analyst who is enthusiastic in understanding and making meaningful data out of it. I have worked in multiple technologies. The best part which I consider is that all my codes are runing sucessfully in production :)

I am intrested in free opensource products and not being language agnostic. Welcome to work with you in all your ideas. We can achive things together.

Started by github to place all teh projects which i am doing to trying do. Some may be half cooked/baked whatever.
